Please note that this is a personal project of mine. Counter-Strike Global Offensive(CSGO), is a video game developed by Valve. Within the game, higher tier players are able to watch footage of suspected cheaters. 

According to Valve's CSGO website, "The Overwatch lets the CS:GO community regulate itself by allowing qualified and experienced members of the community (‘investigators‘) to review reports of disruptive behavior, determine whether those reports are valid, and apply temporary bans if appropriate." 


This is a program to track the decisions made for each counter strike suspect. To run, type "python3 makelist.py" Simply type the results as you go. This will save each result so you can easily print them out later. 

To print, run the reader script using "python3 reader.py" Which will display the suspect number and the conviction.
